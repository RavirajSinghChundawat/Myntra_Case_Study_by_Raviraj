Myntra Apparel Data Analysis Case Study
Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis case study on Myntra’s apparel dataset, focusing on data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and retrieval using Microsoft Excel. The goal of this project is to convert raw e-commerce product data into a clean, analysis-ready dataset and extract meaningful business insights using structured Excel formulas and analytical techniques.

The case study simulates a real-world retail analytics scenario where accurate discount calculations, pricing consistency, and product availability insights are critical for decision-making.

Objectives

Clean and standardize raw apparel product data

Handle missing and inconsistent values systematically

Perform descriptive and conditional analysis on pricing and discounts

Retrieve product-level insights using lookup functions

Create logical classifications for business interpretation

Data Cleaning & Preparation

The following data preparation steps were performed:

Duplicate Check
Verified uniqueness of Product_id and confirmed no duplicate records.

Standardization of Discount Offers

Removed currency symbols and text inconsistencies

Converted percentage-based discounts into numeric values

Recalculated discounts uniformly across the dataset

Handling Missing Values

Filled missing discount values using category-level averages

Replaced missing size information with "Not Available"

Derived Columns

Discount Amount

Discounted Price (rounded using business-friendly logic)

Data Analysis Performed

Key analytical questions answered in this project:

Average original price of products with ratings greater than 4

Count of products with discounts above 50%

Count of products available in Size “M”

Product segmentation into:

High Discount (>50%)

Low Discount (≤50%)

These insights help identify high-value discounts, popular size availability, and premium product segments.

Data Retrieval & Lookup Techniques

Advanced Excel lookup techniques were used to simulate real business queries:

XLOOKUP / VLOOKUP

Retrieve brand, price, and rating using Product ID

INDEX + MATCH

Fetch discounted price for a specific product

Nested XLOOKUP

Dynamically retrieve any column value based on selected Product ID and column name

Data Validation

Dropdown-driven dynamic analysis for flexible reporting

Tools & Functions Used
